-------------
To build the customized AI assistant described in your project, we will implement the necessary components step by step, focusing on each feature as per the project scope. Below is the Python code outline for each of the sections involved in this AI-powered assistant.
Step 1: Document Management

We'll start by implementing document upload, tagging, and full-text search.
Install Required Libraries:

You will need these Python libraries:

    Elasticsearch for advanced searching and indexing.
    PyPDF2 or pdfplumber for PDF document parsing.
    spaCy or NLTK for text processing.

pip install elasticsearch
pip install PyPDF2
pip install pdfplumber
pip install spacy
pip install nltk

Document Upload and Advanced Search using ElasticSearch

import os
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
import PyPDF2
import pdfplumber
import spacy

# Initialize Elasticsearch client
es = Elasticsearch([{'host': 'localhost', 'port': 9200}])

# Indexing Documents in Elasticsearch
def index_document(doc_id, document_text, metadata):
    doc = {
        "text": document_text,
        "metadata": metadata
    }
    es.index(index="research_papers", id=doc_id, body=doc)

# Full-text search function
def search_document(query):
    res = es.search(index="research_papers", body={
        "query": {
            "match": {
                "text": query
            }
        }
    })
    return res['hits']['hits']

# Extracting text from PDFs
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    text = ""
    with open(pdf_path, "rb") as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        for page in range(len(reader.pages)):
            text += reader.pages[page].extract_text()
    return text

# Example: Extract text from a PDF and index it
pdf_path = 'sample_article.pdf'
doc_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
metadata = {
    'source': 'Journal XYZ',
    'author': 'John Doe',
    'publication_date': '2024-03-15',
    'tags': ['Machine Learning', 'NLP']
}

index_document("sample_001", doc_text, metadata)

Step 2: Literature Analysis (Summarization, Thematic Analysis, and Citation Mapping)

We can use libraries like spaCy for extracting themes and keywords, while OpenAI GPT models for summarization.

import spacy
from openai import GPT3

# Initialize spaCy model for NLP tasks
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Summarizing Document using GPT-3 API
import openai
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

def summarize_text(text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-003",
      prompt=f"Summarize the following research paper:\n\n{text}",
      max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example: Summarize a document
doc_text = "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly over the past decade..."
summary = summarize_text(doc_text)
print("Summary:", summary)

# Keyword Extraction and Thematic Analysis using spaCy
def extract_keywords(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    keywords = [token.text for token in doc if token.is_stop == False and token.is_punct == False]
    return keywords

keywords = extract_keywords(doc_text)
print("Extracted Keywords:", keywords)

Step 3: Data Analysis and Visualization

For statistical modeling and visualization, we can use NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Regression Analysis using NumPy and Matplotlib
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 11])

# Linear Regression
coefficients = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
polynomial = np.poly1d(coefficients)

# Plotting the data and regression line
plt.scatter(x, y, color="blue")
plt.plot(x, polynomial(x), color="red")
plt.xlabel("X Values")
plt.ylabel("Y Values")
plt.title("Linear Regression Example")
plt.show()

Step 4: Workflow Automation (Task Tracking and Report Generation)

For automating tasks such as tag assignment and report generation, we can use Python scripting and libraries like ReportLab for creating structured reports.

pip install reportlab

from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

# Example: Generate PDF report
def generate_report(title, content, filename):
    c = canvas.Canvas(filename, pagesize=letter)
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 12)
    c.drawString(100, 750, f"Report: {title}")
    c.drawString(100, 730, f"Content: {content}")
    c.save()

generate_report("Literature Review Summary", "This is a summary of the literature...", "report.pdf")

Step 5: Conversational AI Integration

Integrating GPT-3 for conversational assistance, writing feedback, and idea validation.

import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

def ask_gpt3(question):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=question,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example: Ask the AI a research-related question
question = "What are the key challenges in applying deep learning to natural language processing?"
answer = ask_gpt3(question)
print("AI Answer:", answer)

Step 6: Self-Learning and Adaptive Profiling

For self-learning, you can use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store user preferences and research activity.

pip install sqlite3

import sqlite3

# Set up SQLite database
def create_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('research_assistant.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_profile
                      (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                       topic_preference TEXT,
                       recent_queries TEXT)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Insert user preferences into database
def store_user_preferences(user_id, topic_preference, recent_queries):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('research_assistant.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO user_profile (id, topic_preference, recent_queries) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   (user_id, topic_preference, recent_queries))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Example: Storing preferences
create_db()
store_user_preferences(1, "Deep Learning, NLP", "What is GPT-3?")

Step 7: User Interface

For creating a clean and user-friendly interface, we can use Dash or Streamlit.

pip install dash

import dash
from dash import dcc, html

# Initialize Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Layout of the app
app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1("AI Research Assistant"),
    dcc.Input(id='input-box', type='text', placeholder="Enter your research query here..."),
    html.Button("Submit", id='submit-button'),
    html.Div(id='output-container')
])

# Callback for user input and display
@app.callback(
    dash.dependencies.Output('output-container', 'children'),
    [dash.dependencies.Input('submit-button', 'n_clicks')],
    [dash.dependencies.State('input-box', 'value')]
)
def update_output(n_clicks, input_value):
    if n_clicks is not None:
        return f'You submitted: {input_value}'
    return "Enter a query to get started."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
